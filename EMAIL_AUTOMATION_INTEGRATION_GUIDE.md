## üîß Integration Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the email automation system SQL
\i sql/create_email_automation_system.sql

-- This creates:
-- - email_campaigns table
-- - automation_triggers table
-- - email_logs table
-- - email_templates table
-- - email_sequences table
-- - email_personalization_data table
-- - email_performance_metrics table
```

### Step 2: Add to Your App
```tsx
// In your main App.tsx, add the email automation component
import EmailAutomationIntegration from './components/EmailAutomationIntegration'

// Add to your settings or dashboard page
<EmailAutomationIntegration 
  userId={user.id}
  businessType={userSettings.niche}
  onIntegrationComplete={() => {
    showSuccessMessage('Email automation activated!')
  }}
/>
```

### Step 3: Connect to Existing Automation
```typescript
// In your existing automation handlers, add email triggers
import { EmailAutomationIntegration } from './lib/emailAutomationIntegration'

const emailIntegration = new EmailAutomationIntegration(userId)
await emailIntegration.initialize()

// When appointment is completed
await emailIntegration.handleEvent('appointment_completed', {
  customer_email: appointment.customer_email,
  service: appointment.service,
  appointment_date: appointment.date,
  stylist: appointment.stylist
})

// When new lead is created
await emailIntegration.handleEvent('new_lead_created', {
  email: lead.email,
  name: lead.name,
  source: lead.source
})

// When client becomes inactive
await emailIntegration.handleEvent('client_inactive', {
  email: customer.email,
  days_inactive: 30,
  last_service: customer.last_service
})
```

### Step 4: Configure Business Type
```typescript
// Set up business-specific email campaigns
const businessConfig = {
  salon: {
    campaigns: ['review_request', 're_engagement', 'appointment_reminder'],
    triggers: ['appointment_completed', 'client_inactive', 'new_lead_created']
  },
  medspa: {
    campaigns: ['review_request', 'educational', 'treatment_plan'],
    triggers: ['treatment_completed', 'consultation_scheduled', 'client_inactive']
  },
  realestate: {
    campaigns: ['market_update', 'open_house', 'lead_nurturing'],
    triggers: ['open_house_scheduled', 'market_update', 'new_lead_created']
  }
}
```
