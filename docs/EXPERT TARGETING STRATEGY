EXPERT TARGETING STRATEGY (O-1A, ENGINEERING)

Your goal is NOT to find famous people.
Your goal is to find credible, independent evaluators whose judgment USCIS trusts.

You need 3 experts total, each serving a distinct legal purpose.

THE 3 EXPERT ROLES (DO NOT MIX THEM)
Expert 1 — SYSTEMS AUTHORITY (Core Letter)

Purpose: Prove Original Contribution + Technical Significance

Who this must be:

Principal Engineer / Staff Engineer

Systems Architect

CTO / VP Engineering

From:

Mid-size SaaS (20–300 employees)

SalesTech, MarTech, Workflow Automation, CRM, or Ops platforms

Why this works:
USCIS trusts people who design systems, not influencers.

What they must credibly say:

“I reviewed RAF-GS as a system and evaluated its architecture.”

NOT:

Your manager

A friend

Someone junior to you

Someone who only “used the product”

Expert 2 — OPERATIONAL RELIANCE AUTHORITY

Purpose: Prove Critical Role / Judgment Relied Upon

Who this must be:

CTO

Head of Engineering

Founder (technical)

From:

A company that implemented or evaluated your logic

Even a pilot or internal evaluation is fine

What they must say:

“We relied on his judgment to evaluate and structure our operational decision logic.”

This letter is not about novelty.
It’s about trust in your judgment.

Expert 3 — FIELD CONTEXT AUTHORITY

Purpose: Prove You are above ordinary engineers in this niche

Who this can be:

Senior engineer at a known company

Open-source maintainer in workflow / automation

Conference reviewer / technical advisor

What they do:
They contextualize your work:

“Most systems do X. His system does Y, which is materially different.”

This prevents USCIS from saying:

“This is just normal engineering.”

WHERE TO FIND THESE PEOPLE (REAL SOURCES)
1️⃣ LinkedIn (Primary)

Search titles, not companies:

“Principal Engineer workflow”

“Staff Engineer automation”

“CTO CRM SaaS”

Filter for:

10+ years experience

Currently employed

Not founders of your own startup

2️⃣ Your existing network (HIGH ROI)

Former:

Tech leads

Architects

Senior colleagues

People who reviewed your work before

If someone ever said:

“This design makes sense”

They are a candidate.

3️⃣ Open-source / Tech community (Optional)

Maintainers

Reviewers

Judges you’ve interacted with

This is slower but strong if you already have access.

HOW TO APPROACH THEM (THIS MATTERS)
❌ WRONG approach

“Can you write me an immigration recommendation?”

Instant rejection.

✅ CORRECT approach (SCRIPT — COPY/PASTE)

Subject:

Request for technical review of a deterministic decision system

Message:

Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out because of your background in [systems / workflow / automation]. I’ve designed a deterministic response-aware decision engine for lead engagement, and I’m looking for a technical peer review, not a recommendation.

I’d value your feedback on whether the system design and decision model are sound and differentiated from conventional automation approaches.

If you’re open, I can share a short architectural overview (FSM + decision logic).

Best,
Santhosh

Why this works:

You ask for review, not praise

You appeal to their expertise

It feels professional, not transactional

THE CONVERSION STEP (AFTER THEY REVIEW)

Only after they say:

“This is solid / interesting / well-designed”

You say:

Thank you for reviewing this. I’m preparing an O-1 petition and was advised to include independent expert opinions from senior engineers who evaluated the system.

Would you be comfortable providing an expert opinion letter based on your review? I can provide a structured draft aligned with USCIS requirements.

At this point, conversion rate is high.

WHAT TO SEND THEM (NEVER SEND FULL CODE)

Send ONLY:

FSM diagram (Exhibit A)

1-page system overview (you already have this implicitly)

Short explanation of RAF-GS purpose

Do NOT:

dump GitHub repo

ask them to run code

overwhelm them

TIMELINE (REALISTIC)

Week 1–2: Outreach to 10–15 candidates

Week 3–4: 3–5 agree to review

Week 4–6: Secure 2–3 signed letters

This fits comfortably within your Jan 2027 deadline.
