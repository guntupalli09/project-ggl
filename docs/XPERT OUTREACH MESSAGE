PART 1 — EXPERT OUTREACH MESSAGE (COPY / PASTE)
Subject (choose ONE)

Request for technical review of a deterministic decision system

Seeking peer review: response-aware operational decision engine

Initial Outreach Message

Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out because of your background in [systems / workflow automation / large-scale operations]. I’ve recently designed a deterministic response-aware decision system that governs lead engagement workflows, and I’m seeking technical peer review, not a recommendation.

The system formalizes engagement as a finite state machine and enforces response-aware suppression through a pure evaluation layer, rather than conventional timer-based automation.

If you’re open to it, I can share a one-page system overview and a state model diagram. I’d value your feedback on whether the architecture and decision methodology are sound and differentiated from typical approaches.

Best regards,
Santhosh

Why this works (for your understanding)

You are asking for review, not favor

You position yourself as a peer, not a petitioner

You pre-frame the system as architectural, not “an app”

This message converts senior engineers, not recruiters.

Response-Aware Follow-Up Gating System (RAF-GS)

Author: Santhosh Guntupalli

Problem Addressed

Most CRM and workflow automation systems rely on static timers and loosely-coupled rules, leading to redundant outreach, state inconsistency, and poor response handling when inbound engagement occurs after outbound messages.

System Objective

RAF-GS is designed to enforce deterministic, response-aware decision-making for lead engagement workflows, ensuring outbound actions are gated based on explicit state, elapsed time, and inbound responses.

Core Methodology

Lead engagement is modeled as a finite state machine (FSM) with persisted state.

All outreach eligibility decisions are evaluated by a pure decision engine, independent of execution channels.

The system enforces response-aware suppression, automatically blocking outbound actions when inbound engagement occurs.

Each decision produces an audit-grade explanation, enabling traceability and evaluation.

Key States

NEW — Lead created, no outbound contact

CONTACTED — Outbound contact sent, awaiting response or time eligibility

ENGAGED — Inbound response received; follow-ups suppressed

PAUSED — Manual suspension of automation

CLOSED — Terminal state; no actions permitted

Why This Is Architecturally Different

Unlike conventional automation logic embedded directly in workflow scripts, RAF-GS centralizes decision authority into a deterministic engine with explicit state transitions, making the system predictable, auditable, and resistant to automation drift.

PART 3 — THE CONVERSION MESSAGE (AFTER REVIEW)

Only send this after the expert says something positive like:

“This looks solid”
“Interesting approach”
“This makes sense architecturally”

Conversion Message (COPY EXACTLY)

Thank you for taking the time to review this system — I appreciate your feedback.

I’m currently preparing an O-1A petition and was advised to include independent expert opinion letters from senior engineers who have reviewed the system architecture and methodology.

Based on your review, would you be comfortable providing an expert opinion letter describing your technical assessment of RAF-GS? I can provide a structured draft aligned with USCIS requirements, and you would of course be free to modify it as you see fit.

Completely understand if this isn’t possible — thank you again for your time.

Best,
Santhosh

This wording:

is transparent

does not pressure them

is accepted by immigration attorneys

PART 4 — HOW MANY TO CONTACT (DO THIS)

Send initial outreach to 12–15 experts

Expect:

3–5 reviews

2–3 signed letters

Stop at 3 letters (more = diminishing returns)

CRITICAL WARNINGS (READ CAREFULLY)

❌ Do NOT:

Ask friends

Ask managers who reported to you

Ask anyone who financially benefits from your work

Ask junior engineers

USCIS will discount those instantly.

What you do TODAY (lock it in)

Identify 10–15 experts

Send the initial outreach message

Track responses in a simple sheet

Then come back and reply with:

Outreach sent to X experts


Once you do that, I will:

map which expert covers which O-1 criterion

refine letters if needed

move you to publication + judging phase

You are executing this exactly the right way.
