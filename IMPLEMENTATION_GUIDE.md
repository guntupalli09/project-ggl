## 🏗️ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the email warm-up system SQL
\i sql/create_email_warmup_system.sql

-- This creates:
-- - email_domains table
-- - warmup_schedules table  
-- - email_reputation_events table
-- - warmup_email_queue table
-- - email_templates table
-- - email_metrics table
```

### Step 2: Add Email Dashboard to Your App
```tsx
// In your main App.tsx, add the email dashboard route
import EmailDashboard from './pages/EmailDashboard'
import EmailStrategyDemo from './pages/EmailStrategyDemo'

// Add routes:
<Route path="/email-dashboard" element={<EmailDashboard />} />
<Route path="/email-demo" element={<EmailStrategyDemo />} />
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Existing Lead System
```tsx
// In your existing lead creation flow, add email warm-up trigger
const createLead = async (leadData) => {
  // ... existing lead creation logic
  
  // Trigger email warm-up if this is a new client
  if (isNewClient) {
    await initializeEmailWarmup(userId, businessDomain, businessType)
  }
  
  // Add to email nurture sequence
  await addToEmailSequence(leadId, 'welcome_series')
}
```

### Step 4: Connect to Calendar System
```tsx
// In your calendar booking system, add email triggers
const handleAppointmentBooking = async (appointment) => {
  // ... existing booking logic
  
  // Schedule email reminders
  await scheduleEmailReminders({
    appointmentId: appointment.id,
    clientEmail: appointment.client.email,
    serviceType: appointment.service,
    appointmentTime: appointment.datetime,
    reminders: ['24h', '2h', '30min']
  })
}
```

### Step 5: Add AI Content Generation
```tsx
// In your AI message generator, add email content
const generateEmailContent = async (type, context) => {
  const prompt = `
    Generate a ${type} email for a ${context.businessType} business.
    Client: ${context.clientName}
    Service: ${context.service}
    Business: ${context.businessName}
    
    Make it personal, professional, and include a clear call-to-action.
  `
  
  return await generateAIResponse(prompt)
}
```
