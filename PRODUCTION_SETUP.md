# 🚀 Production Setup Guide

## ✅ **Production-Ready Automation System**

Your GGL lead generation app now has a **production-ready automation system** that actually works! Here's what's been implemented:

### **🎯 Core Features**

1. **Real Email Sending** - Integrates with SendGrid for actual email delivery
2. **Smart Follow-ups** - Only contacts leads who haven't responded
3. **Manual Response Tracking** - You control when leads have responded
4. **Vercel Cron Jobs** - Runs every 30 minutes automatically
5. **AI-Powered Messages** - Uses Ollama for personalized content

### **🔧 Environment Variables Required**

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# SendGrid (for real email sending)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Internal API (for cron jobs)
INTERNAL_API_KEY=your_secure_internal_key

# Supabase (for cron jobs)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### **📊 Database Tables**

Make sure these tables exist in your Supabase database:

1. **`leads`** - Your lead data
2. **`messages`** - Email tracking
3. **`automations`** - Automation settings
4. **`user_settings`** - User preferences
5. **`automation_runs`** - Automation execution history
6. **`automation_run_details`** - Individual message details

### **⚙️ How It Works**

1. **Every 30 minutes**, Vercel runs the cron job
2. **System checks** for leads that need follow-up:
   - Status is 'new', 'contacted', or 'no_response'
   - No recent inbound messages (you marked as responded)
   - Last outbound message was sent more than X minutes ago
3. **AI generates** personalized follow-up messages
4. **Real emails** are sent via SendGrid
5. **Lead status** is updated to 'contacted'
6. **Message record** is created for tracking

### **🎛️ Control Panel**

- **Go to `/automations`** to manage your automation settings
- **Toggle ON/OFF** for "No reply in 24h" automation
- **View stats** - messages sent today, total messages, last run time
- **Full History** - See exactly what happened in each automation run
- **Message Details** - View every message sent, to whom, and when
- **Error Tracking** - See any failures and why they happened
- **Manual tracking** - Use Response Tracker in Leads table

### **📧 Email Setup**

1. **Sign up for SendGrid** (free tier available)
2. **Get your API key** from SendGrid dashboard
3. **Add to Vercel** environment variables
4. **Verify your domain** in SendGrid (optional but recommended)

### **🚀 Deployment**

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production-ready automation system"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Test the system**:
   - Add some leads with status 'new'
   - Wait 30 minutes or manually trigger
   - Check your email for follow-up messages

### **🔍 Monitoring**

- **Vercel Functions** - Check cron job logs
- **SendGrid Dashboard** - Monitor email delivery
- **Supabase Logs** - Track database operations
- **App Dashboard** - View automation stats

### **🛡️ Security**

- **Internal API key** protects cron endpoints
- **Row Level Security** in Supabase
- **Email validation** before sending
- **Rate limiting** via Vercel

### **📈 What Happens Next**

1. **Leads are added** to your system
2. **Automation runs** every 30 minutes
3. **AI generates** personalized follow-ups
4. **Real emails** are sent to leads
5. **You track responses** manually
6. **System respects** your response tracking
7. **ROI increases** with consistent follow-ups

## 🎉 **You're Ready for Production!**
